# Bug Issue Tracker App
A web application that tracks its own bugs and issues.

## 🚀 Getting Started
These instructions are to get you up and running

`npm install`

`mongod`

Open a new terminal in the same directory

`node server`

Open another terminal in the same directory

`cd client`

`npm install`

`npm start`

The app should be up and running!

## 🙇‍ Motivation to build app
I wanted to create some sort of a CRUD app on the MERN stack without making a todo app.\
I thought this app would be interesting to see how it builds upon itself.
